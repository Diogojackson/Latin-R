  abstract = {Animal communication theory predicts that low\textendash frequency cheating should be common in generally honest signalling systems. However, perhaps because cheats are designed to go undetected, there are few examples of dishonest signals in natural populations. Here we present what we believe is the first example of a dishonest signal which is used commonly by males to attract mates and fight sexual rivals. After losing their large claw, male fiddler crabs (Uca annulipes) grow a new one which has less mass, is a less effective weapon and costs less to use in signalling than an equivalent\textendash length claw of the original form. Males with original claws do not differentially fight males with regenerated claws even though they are likely to win. Regenerated claws effectively bluff fighting ability and deter potential opponents before they fight. During mate searching, females do not discriminate against males with low\textendash mass, regenerated claws, indicating that they are deceived as to the true costs males pay to produce sexual signals. Up to 44\% of males in natural populations have regenerated claws, a level unanticipated by current signalling theory. The apparent rarity of cheating may be an artefact of the usual difficulty of detecting cheats and dishonesty may be quite common.},

  abstract = {Abstract Mud fiddler crabs, Uca pugnax, have a streak of blue coloration located on the front of the carapace above the mouth and centered between the eyes. We documented that this blue streak is absent in juveniles and develops as crabs become sexually mature. By photographing male crabs under controlled conditions in the laboratory, we demonstrated that the brightness of the blue streak (in comparison with the rest of the carapace) is dynamic, and can dim from bright blue to nearly black in fewer than two minutes. We examined blue streak variability in male crabs in response to physical factors (light and temperature) and social context to begin to understand what causes its dynamic response. The blue streak darkens in response to decreased ambient light, but does not respond to changes in temperature. In the field, it is brighter when crabs are roaming on the mudflat or fighting, but darker when crabs are basking or performing waving displays. The highly visual nature of fiddler crabs and the dynamic character of the blue streak suggest that it may communicate information about the state of a crab or its environment.},

  abstract = {Many lizard species use caudal autotomy to escape entrapment. Conspicuous coloration may increase the likelihood of being attacked, but if that attack can be directed towards the autotomous tail this may ultimately increase the chances of the lizard surviving a predatory attack. We tested the hypothesis that brightly-colored tails function to divert predatory attention away from the head and body using pairs of blue-tailed and all-brown clay model lizards. Predatory bird attacks on the 24 blue-tailed models occurred sooner (P = 0.001) than attacks on the 24 all-brown models, and over 7 days blue-tailed models were attacked more often than all-brown models (P = 0.007). Blue-tailed models were, however, more frequently attacked on the tail than other parts of the body (P \&lt; 0.001), while all-brown models were more frequently attacked on the head and body (P = 0.019) which would be more likely to be fatal for a real lizard. Our results suggest that models with a blue tail were more conspicuous than all-brown models, attracting attacks sooner and more often, but that the attacks were predominantly directed at the tail. It is better for individuals to be attacked unsuccessfully many times, than successfully just once. Having a brightly-colored tail may, therefore, act as a `risky decoy'. Despite increased conspicuousness, a blue tail increases the likelihood that the lizard would be able to effect escape through caudal autotomy rather than being grabbed by the head or body.},

The sediment of the squares at each transect was analysed    for grain size, organic matter and humidity. Morphology of the second maxilliped    was studied considering the number of spoon-tipped setae to help explain    the ecological distribution of the species. U. leptodactyla and U.    rapax    were found living in medium sand, U. thayeri was collected in fine and very    fine sand, while U. maracoani was found living in very fine sand. U.    leptodactyla showed a negative correlation with organic matter and humidity while U.    thayeri    showed a positive correlations for both factors. U.    maracoani and U. rapax    were not correlated with organic matter or humidity. The analysis of the    second maxilliped revealed that U. leptodactyla and U.    rapax show a high    quantity of spoon-tipped setae while U. maracoani and U.    thayeri show a greater  quantity of plumose setae.},

Overall, when offered crabs on an exposed surface, ibises chose female and declawed male crabs four times as often as intact male crabs . When probing into artificial burrows containing either a male or female crab, all seven ibises rejected male crabs almost twice as often as they did female crabs . During encounters both with crabs on the surface and with crabs in burrows, ibises appeared to be especially wary of the enlarged claw of male crabs .

That decade saw explosive growth in this field: the game theoretical underpinnings of signal evolution were formalized and classified, the study of visual signals caught up with and, in some respects, surpassed the prior dominance of acoustic and olfactory signals in animal communication research, and major advances occurred at the interfaces between animal communication and neurobiology, immunology, endocrinology, evolutionary genetics, economics, and conservation biology. Even the philosophers got in on the act. As scientific fields reach middle age, one often sees polarization into opposing camps on theoretical issues. Current debates in behavioral ecology include the role of information in animal communication, the relative importance of inclusive fitness versus network topologies in shaping the evolution of cooperation, whether sexual selection is cooperative or competitive, and which type of evolutionary model best predicts observed patterns of animal behavior. Because we are writing a text about "principles," we have often had to review the evidence for alternative viewpoints and indicate which way we think the issue is leaning. Our judgments will surely gratify some colleagues and elicit dissent from others. Only time will determine how often we got it right. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Studies suggest that selection has fine tuned these weapons to improve their effectiveness and that the shape of these weapons provides cues for males to assess the strength of rivals. Similarly, females might also assess a male's weaponry to determine his value as a mate. The largest weapon relative to body size is the major claw of male fiddler crabs (genus: Uca). Males use their claws both as a weapon and as a courtship signal, waving it to attract females. We used robotic crabs in two-choice experiments to test female mating preferences based on male claw shape in Uca mjoebergi. First, females did not prefer conspecific claws over any of three alternatively shaped stimuli matched for color and for the rate and pattern of waving. The alternative stimuli were two different heterospecific claws and a plain rectangular shape. Second, females significantly preferred the alternative stimuli when they were presented at a faster wave rate. We conclude that claw shape in U. mjoebergi has not evolved under sexual selection imposed by female mating preferences and is more likely to have evolved under selection for effectiveness during male\textendash male competition.},

Mating, oviposition and incubation (breeding) occur underground in males' burrows. Some courting males build mud pillars (2 cm high) at the entrance of their burrow. The purpose of this field study was to assess the role of pillars in competitive courtship signaling among males. I studied the effect of pillars on female behavior by recording the responses of wandering females to courtship from males resident at burrows with and without pillars. I also caught females, released them individually in a circular arena with an equal number of empty burrows with and without pillars around its circumference, and chased the females with a simulated avian predator. Females moved to burrows of both types more often when they were courted (82\%) than when they were chased (67\%). Receptive females were attracted to the burrows of the males that courted them significantly more often (97\%) when these burrows had pillars than when they lacked pillars (66\%). However, once females entered males' burrows they were equally likely to remain, mate and breed in both types of burrows. Females also more often moved to burrows with pillars (66\%) than to burrows without pillars when they ran from the simulated predator. Both male courtship displays and pillars probably provide cues females use to locate males' burrows. The visual similarity between pillars and a display courting males give immediately before they enter their burrows suggests that pillars are icons of the display. The effect of pillars on female behavior, the timing of pillar building relative to when females choose mates, and contrasts in the behavior of males that do and those that do not build pillars suggest that pillar building has evolved due to competition among males to attract females into their burrows.},

Autotomy of the major claw accelerated molting. Yet contrary to expectations, autotomy of the claw initially inhibited feeding, with evidence for release of feeding inhibitory factor.

Crustaceans, like fiddler crabs (genus Uca), are particularly adept at changing their colour and have been the focus of numerous studies. However, few of these studies have attempted to quantitatively describe the individual variation in colour and pattern or their adaptive significance. This paper quantitatively describes the colour patterns of the fiddler crab Uca capricornis and their ability to change on a socially significant timescale. The most dramatic changes in colour pattern are associated with moulting. These ontogenetic changes result in a general reduction of the colour pattern with increasing size, although females are more colourful and variable than similarly-sized males. Uca capricornis are also capable of rapid colour changes in response to stress, but show no endogenous rhythms associated with the semilunar and tidal cycles commonly reported in other fiddler crabs. The extreme colour polymorphism and the relative stability of the colour patterns in Uca capricornis are consistent with their use in visually mediated mate recognition.},

Colorful bird and lizard signals have received much attention, and many studies have related specific spectral properties of these signals to variation in mating success and territory defense. Far less attention has been given to invertebrates even though there are spectacularly colorful species. The enlarged claw of the male banana fiddler crab Austruca mjoebergi, for example, is bright yellow and contrasts vividly against the mudflat substrate. It is used in waving displays to attract females and in male territory defense and combat. Claw color varies among males in the degree of ``yellowness,'' ranging very pale yellow to orange. In this study, we examined female responses to claw color variation in two-choice tests using robotic crabs. We found that although females strongly discriminate against colors that fall outside the natural range of intensity, hue, and chroma, they show no consistent preferences for different claw colors within the natural range, and no single component of claw color (hue, chroma, or intensity) independently affected female choices. Using three-choice tests, we also showed that female preferences induce stabilizing selection on male claw color. We conclude that, although claw color is sufficient to facilitate species recognition, it is unlikely to be used in intraspecific mate choice to provide information about male quality.},

  abstract = {Abstract Autotomy has evolved independently several times in different animal lineages. It frequently involves immediate functional costs, so regeneration evolved in many instances to restore the functionality of that body part. Caudal autotomy is a widespread antipredator strategy in lizards, although it may affect energy storage, locomotion dynamics, or survival in future encounters with predators. Here, we assessed the effect of tail loss on the locomotor performance of wall lizards (Podarcis muralis), as well as the recovery of locomotor functionality of lizards with regenerated tails, and the movement dynamics of shed tails that were either intact or having regenerated portions. Tail loss had no effect on locomotion over unhindered spaces, possibly due to compensation between a negative effect on the stride of front limbs, and a positive effect of losing mass and friction force. We found a clear negative impact of tail loss on locomotion in spaces with interspersed obstacles, in which tailed lizards jumped larger distances when leaving the obstacles. Besides, lizards that used the tail to push off the ground were able to approach the obstacles from further, so that the tail seemed to be useful when used during jumping. Regeneration fully restores lizard's locomotor capacities, but tail antipredator value, as indicated by the intensity of post-autotomic movements, is only partially retrieved. From these results, we propose that, together with the recovery of post-autotomy antipredator capacities, the restoration of the organismal locomotor performance may have been an important, yet frequently neglected factor in the evolution of lizard's regeneration ability.},

In this article, we discuss the spectral characteristics and genetic mechanisms of the spectral tuning of avian visual pigments. The avian retina contains a single type of rod, four spectrally distinct types of single cone, and a single type of double cone photoreceptor. Only the single cones are thought to be involved in color discrimination; double cones are thought to be involved in achromatic visual tasks, such as movement detection and pattern recognition. Visual pigment opsin protein genes in birds are orthologous to those in other vertebrates and have a common origin early in vertebrate evolution. Mechanisms of spectral tuning in the different classes of avian cone visual pigments show similarities in most instances to those in other vertebrates. The exception is the ultraviolet/violet (SWS1) class of pigments; phylogenetic evidence indicates that the ancestral vertebrate SWS1 pigment was ultraviolet sensitive (UVS), with different molecular mechanisms accounting for the generation of violet-sensitive (VS) pigments in different vertebrate classes. In birds, however, UVS visual pigments have re-evolved from an ancestral avian VS pigment by using a novel molecular mechanism not seen in other vertebrate classes. This has occurred independently in four of the 14 avian orders examined to date, although the adaptive significance of this is currently unknown.},

  abstract = {A longstanding hypothesis in evolutionary biology is that trade-offs between natural and sexual selection often underlie the diversification of sexual signals in the wild. A classic example of this ``selection trade-off hypothesis'' proposes that males evolve elaborate and conspicuous ornamentation in low-risk environments where female preferences dominate selection on sexual traits, but they evolve muted and relatively cryptic sexual traits in high-risk environments where selection from predators acts against conspicuous sexual traits and female preferences potentially weaken or reverse. However, little direct empirical evidence supports this notion. Using the model system of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi)\textemdash where males have recently evolved greater orange coloration in their dorsal fins in blue holes lacking predatory fish relative to populations with fish predators\textemdash we tested this hypothesis using fish replicas differing only in dorsal-fin color. Specifically, we employed plastic fish models in a combination of field and lab experiments to directly examine conspicuity to predators and female preferences for dorsal-fin color. We found that orange-shifted dorsal fins resembling the color exhibited in predator-free populations appeared more conspicuous to predatory bigmouth sleepers (Gobiomorus dormitor) that are evolutionarily naive to mosquitofish. Wild-caught female mosquitofish preferred the orange-shifted dorsal-fin model during dichotomous choice tests; evolutionary history with predators did not affect female preferences. Similar mate-choice trials with lab-born virgin females also found preferences for the orange-shifted dorsal-fin model and revealed significant genetic variation for female preferences. Our study provides direct empirical evidence documenting a trade-off between natural and sexual selection in a colorful sexual signal.},

We tested whether crab populations may become cryptic under the influence of bird predation by counting birds overflying or feeding on differently coloured colonies. Colonies with cryptically coloured crabs indeed experience a much higher level of bird presence, compared to colourful colonies. We show in addition that colourful crab individuals subjected to dummy bird predation do change their body colouration over a matter of days. The crabs thus appear to modify their social signalling system depending on their assessment of predation risk.},

The trichromatic colour vision of honeybees shares fundamental properties with primate and human colour perception, such as colour constancy, colour opponency, segregation of colour and brightness coding. Laborious efforts to reconstruct the colour vision pathway in the honeybee have provided detailed descriptions of neural connectivity and the properties of photoreceptors and interneurons in the optic lobes of the bee brain. The modelling of colour perception advanced with the establishment of colour discrimination models that were based on experimental data, the Colour-Opponent Coding and Receptor Noise-Limited models, which are important tools for the quantitative assessment of bee colour vision and colour-guided behaviours. Major insights into the visual ecology of bees have been gained combining behavioural experiments and quantitative modelling, and asking how bee vision has influenced the evolution of flower colours and patterns. Recently research has focussed on the discrimination and categorisation of coloured patterns, colourful scenes and various other groupings of coloured stimuli, highlighting the bees' behavioural flexibility. The identification of perceptual mechanisms remains of fundamental importance for the interpretation of their learning strategies and performance in diverse experimental tasks.},

Two types of signals were recorded in different experiments: slow potentials (electroretinogram) and fast potentials (spikes). The latter were also recorded in the presence of a continuous green or red adapting light. The resulting visual spectral-sensitivity curves, when fitted to rhodopsin-based visual pigment absorption spectra (from Dartnall nomograms), indicated the presence of two visual pigments, one with an absorption maximum near 430~nm, and the other with a peak absorption between 500~nm and 540~nm. The data also provided evidence for some differential bleaching of the pigments in the presence of a colored adapting light, but most of the adaptation effect was probably due to changes in screening pigment and neural desensitization or inhibition. These two observations suggest that an adequate substrate for color vision may exist in this and other species of fiddler crabs. The electroretinogram and spike-recording methods produced similar visual-sensitivity data, suggesting that latter technique, a much more efficient way of collecting data that is physiologically relevant, may be the method of choice for determining spectral sensitivity in crustaceans.},

  abstract = {Deflection occurs in predator\textendash prey interactions where prey possess traits that influence the position of the predator's initial contact with the prey's body in a way that enhances the prey's probability of survival when attacked. As an anti-predatory defence occurring late in the sequence of an attack, deflection is an understudied but fascinating strategy that involves a range of unusual adaptations in diverse prey species. Deflective traits have been postulated to be important to the defensive strategies of a range of organisms, but although evidence for their existence is variable among groups, we argue that previous research neglects some promising taxa. As a defence, deflection will probably play a crucial role in the behavioural ecology and evolution of both prey species and their predators; as such, it warrants greater interest from zoologists. Here, we first summarize what is known about deflection from the current literature. We next offer predictions about the co-evolutionary possibilities surrounding deflection, based on the benefits and costs experienced by prey and their predators. Finally, we outline the most interesting outstanding avenues for future research in the field of deflection and make new suggestions as to how they could be explored usefully.},

Surprisingly, however, the adaptive function of this association has never been investigated experimentally. We tested whether the risk of being detected by a predator is affected by crypsis, movement or an interaction between these two traits. We show that, to avoid being detected and attacked by three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.), chironomid larvae need both to match their background and to keep still. Additionally, relatively more active individuals were targeted from cryptic prey groups, but not from conspicuous ones. Therefore, rather than crypsis and keeping still both contributing to reducing detection, the two traits are synergistic in reducing detection rates. This interdependence has implications for the coevolution of background matching and motion, and also between anti-predator traits and predators' visual systems.},

We examined the visual pigments of two North-American species (Uca pugnax and U. pugilator), one species from the Indo-West Pacific (U. vomeris) and the only Eastern-Atlantic species (U. tangeri) of fiddler crabs using in situ microspectrophotometry of frozen sections of dark-adapted eyes. Only one spectral class of visual receptor was found in the larger (R1-7) retinular cells of each species, with maximum absorption peaking between 508 nm and 530 nm (depending upon species). The R8 retinular cell, that might contain a short-wavelength sensitive photopigment and provide a basis for colour vision, was too small to analyze by these methods. Rhabdoms were lined with screening pigment which strongly influenced each species' spectral sensitivity, sharpening the peak and shifting the maximum towards longer wavelengths, on occasion to as far as the 600 nm region. We hypothesize that sensitivity to longer wavelengths enhances contrast between background (blue sky or tall vegetation) and the male major claw during the waving display.},

Many animals in most phyla have since then been shown to have colour vision. Colour is used for specific behaviours, such as phototaxis and object recognition, while other behaviours such as motion detection are colour blind. Having established the existence of colour vision, research focussed on the question of how many spectral types of photoreceptors are involved. Recently, data on photoreceptor spectral sensitivities have been combined with behavioural experiments and physiological models to study systematically the next logical question: ?what neural interactions underlie colour vision ??This review gives an overview of the methods used to study animal colour vision, and discusses how quantitative modelling can suggest how photoreceptor signals are combined and compared to allow for the discrimination of biologically relevant stimuli.},

  abstract = {The avian retina possesses one of the most sophisticated cone photoreceptor systems among vertebrates. Birds have five types of cones including four single cones, which support tetrachromatic color vision and a double cone, which is thought to mediate achromatic motion perception. Despite this richness, very little is known about the spatial organization of avian cones and its adaptive significance. Here we show that the five cone types of the chicken independently tile the retina as highly ordered mosaics with a characteristic spacing between cones of the same type. Measures of topological order indicate that double cones are more highly ordered than single cones, possibly reflecting their posited role in motion detection. Although cones show spacing interactions that are cell type-specific, all cone types use the same density-dependent yardstick to measure intercone distance. We propose a simple developmental model that can account for these observations. We also show that a single parameter, the global regularity index, defines the regularity of all five cone mosaics. Lastly, we demonstrate similar cone distributions in three additional avian species, suggesting that these patterning principles are universal among birds. Since regular photoreceptor spacing is critical for uniform sampling of visual space, the cone mosaics of the avian retina represent an elegant example of the emergence of adaptive global patterning secondary to simple local interactions between individual photoreceptors. Our results indicate that the evolutionary pressures that gave rise to the avian retina's various adaptations for enhanced color discrimination also acted to fine-tune its spatial sampling of color and luminance.},

Here we introduce pavo 2, the latest iteration of the r package pavo. This release represents the extensive refinement and expansion of existing methods, as well as a suite of new tools for the cohesive analysis of the spectral and (now) spatial structure of colour patterns and perception. At its core, the package retains a broad focus on (a) the organization and processing of spectral and spatial data, and tools for the alternating (b) visualization, and (c) analysis of data. Significantly, pavo 2 introduces image-analysis capabilities, providing a cohesive workflow for the comprehensive analysis of colour patterns. We demonstrate the utility of pavo with a brief example centred on mimicry in Heliconius butterflies. Drawing on visual modelling, adjacency, and boundary strength analyses, we show that the combined spectral (colour and luminance) and spatial (pattern element distribution and boundary salience) features of putative models and mimics are closely aligned. pavo 2 offers a flexible and reproducible environment for the analysis of colour, with renewed potential to assist researchers in answering fundamental questions in sensory ecology and evolution.},

Double cones possessed a P568 in both the principal and accessory members. A pale droplet with variable absorbance (maximal at about 420 nm) was associated with the principal member whereas the ellipsoid region of the accessory member contained only low concentrations of carotenoid. The effective spectral sensitivities of the different cone classes were calculated from the characteristic combinations of oil droplets and photopigments and corrected for the absorbance of the ocular media.

However, it remains unclear whether the strength of warning colours reliably indicate levels of defence. Few studies have unambiguously established if warning signals are honest and have rarely considered predator vision or conspicuousness against the background. Importantly, little data exists either on how differences in signal strength translate into survival advantages. Ladybirds exhibit impressive variation in coloration both among and within species. Here we demonstrate that different levels of toxicity exist among and within ladybird species and that signal contrast against the background is a good predictor of toxicity, showing that the colours are honest signals. Furthermore, field experiments with ladybird models created with regards to predator vision show that models with lower conspicuousness were attacked more frequently. This provides one of the most comprehensive studies on signal honesty in warning coloration to date.},

Furthermore, males appear to adjust their waving according to the information available: eavesdropping males wave 12 times faster than non-courting males but only 1.7 times slower than males in full visual contact with the female.},

The aim of this study is to find key environmental parameters which affect the distribution of fiddler crabs and to determine the habitats in which each species was most abundant. Crabs were collected from 19 sites within the mudflats of Sepang-Lukut mangrove forest. Temperature, porewater salinity, organic matter, water content, carbon and nitrogen content, porosity, chlorophyll content, pH, redox potential, sediment texture and heavy metals were determined in each 1 m2 quadrate. Pearson correlation indicated that all sediment properties except pH and redox potential were correlated with sediment grain size. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that Uca paradussumieri was negatively correlated with salinity and redox potential. Sand dwelling species, Uca perplexa and Uca annulipes, were highly dependent on the abundance of 250 {$\mu$}m and 150 {$\mu$}m grain size particles in the sediment. Canonical Discriminative Analysis (CDA) indicated that variation in sediment grain size best explained where each crab species was most abundant. Moreover, U. paradussumieri commonly occupies muddy substrates of low shore, while U. forcipata lives under the shade of mangrove trees. U. annulipes and U. perplexa with the high number of spoon tipped setae on their second maxiliped are specialized to feed on the sandy sediments. U. rosea and U. triangularis are more common on muddy sediment with high sediment density. In conclusion, sediment grain size that influences most sediment properties acts as a main factor responsible for sediment heterogeneity. In this paper, the correlation between fiddler crab species and environmental parameters, as well as the interaction between sediment characteristics, was explained in order to define the important environmental factors in fiddler crab distributions.},

The signal involves waving the unflexed large claw up and down. To determine whether the spatiotemporal structure of the wave is under selection by female choice, we examined whether females had a preference for any particular features of the wave. Females respond to a waving display by either visiting the male's burrow entrance or by electing to pass without visiting the burrow. We filmed mate-searching females and the waving males that they visited or passed. We documented the wave structure of these males using frame-by-frame analysis. Males produce a two-part wave with component A preceding component B. Both components have an upstroke, a pause at the apex and a downstroke. The tip of the claw was raised much higher in B than in A. Visited males had a shorter delay between the two wave components than did males that the females passed without visiting. Visited males also produced component B waves that had a slower upstroke than those of passed males. There was a significant correlation between the relative height of the raised claw and the duration of the upstroke of component B. Females were selecting males that raised their major claw to the highest position (two to three times as high as the carapace width). Passed males brought down their major claw earlier and from a lower position than did visited males. The data suggests that wave structure has evolved through female choice. Male display rate and body size were not female choice cues. An earlier study showed that display duration was also not used by females in selecting mates.},

  abstract = {Understanding the functions of animal coloration has been a long-standing question in evolutionary biology. For example, the widespread occurrence of striking longitudinal stripes and colourful tails in lizards begs for an explanation. Experiments have suggested that colourful tails can deflect attacks towards the tail (the `deflection' hypothesis), which is sacrificable in most lizards, thereby increasing the chance of escape. Studies also suggest that in moving lizards, longitudinal body stripes can redirect predators' strikes towards the tail through the `motion dazzle' effect. Despite these experimental studies, the ecological factors associated with the evolution of such striking colorations remain unexplored. Here, we investigated whether predictions from motion dazzle and attack deflection could explain the widespread occurrence of these striking marks using comparative methods and information on eco-physiological variables (caudal autotomy, diel activity, microhabitat and body temperature) potentially linked to their functioning. We found both longitudinal stripes and colourful tails are associated with diurnal activity and with the ability to lose the tail. Compared to stripeless species, striped species are more likely to be ground-dwelling and have higher body temperature, emphasizing the connection of stripes to mobility and rapid escape strategy. Colourful tails and stripes have evolved multiple times in a correlated fashion, suggesting that their functions may be linked. Overall, our results together with previous experimental studies support the notion that stripes and colourful tails in lizards may have protective functions based on deflective and motion dazzle effects.},

However, the ecological factors that influence the relationships between age, tail colour and antipredatory strategy remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigated how antipredatory behaviours vary according to age in Bosk's fringe-toed lizard (Acanthodactylus boskianus), a species that shows ontogenetic changes in tail colour. First, we verified whether tail conspicuousness increases the probability of predatory attacks, by using two types of plasticine models made to mimic juveniles (red-tailed models) and adults (beige-tailed models) and distributed in a study plot where an avian predator is abundant. We found that juvenile-like red tails were more frequently attacked by predators than the less conspicuous adult-like ones. We also conducted predation simulation experiments on active lizards of different ages and compared their risk-taking and escape behaviours. Adults occurred close to potential refuges (i.e. bushes), while juveniles were more commonly observed in open microhabitats. When approached by the observer, adults rarely conducted tail displays and usually fled in a non-stop way to penetrate inside the nearest bush. However, juveniles conducted tail displays and never fled directly inside a bush. They usually stopped near the target bush and tolerated a closer approach from the observer before making the decision to take refuge inside the bush. It seems that juveniles feared the attacks of adults and avoided entering bushes occupied by adults. Repeated observations of adults acting aggressively towards juveniles provide support for this hypothesis. Overall, our findings highlight the role of tail conspicuousness in the diversion of predatory attacks from the vital parts of the body in the juveniles of Bosk's fringe-toed lizard. They also suggest that agonistic interactions between adults and juveniles play important roles in shaping their antipredatory behaviour.},

  abstract = {In mangroves, species specific spatial habitat zonation preference of fiddler crabs could influence the functioning of mangrove ecosystems. Spatial zonation of fiddler crabs in tropical Malaysian mangroves across different temporal scales has not been studied extensively. In this study, the abundance and species richness of several fiddler crab species across a mangrove intertidal zone were examined in relation to environmental variables. Fiddler crab abundance was sampled with salinity, pH, temperature, and sediment grain size in three mangrove sites in Penang Island, Malaysia. The sampling design involved collecting crabs and environmental habitat variables in six 2 m \texttimes{} 2 m quadrats within three mangrove study sites from March 2017 to February 2018. Data were analysed using multivariate (PERMANOVA, SIMPER, and BEST in PRIMER v7.0) and univariate analyses (ANOVA and Pearson's r in STATISTICA v 13.30). Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed multiple spatial and temporal scales influenced each fiddler crab species differently (ANOVA p {$<$} 0.05). Fiddler crab abundance varied across and within sites, intertidal zones, and sampling months (PERMANOVA, p {$<$} 0.001). Austruca annulipes, Gelasimus vocans and Tubuca paradussumieri were found mostly at the lower intertidal zone, which was characterized by a higher sand faction. Tubuca rosea, Tubuca forcipata, and Austruca bengali occupied and coexisted in the middle and higher zones of the intertidal, although this pattern varied across the different sites in this study. BEST analysis indicated that porewater salinity and sediment particle size were important factors in structuring patterns of fiddler crab assemblages. Based on univariate correlation analyses, the total abundance of fiddler crab increased with increased temperature (temperature ranged from 26.9 {$\smwhtcircle$}C to 31.7 {$\smwhtcircle$}C), and increased porewater salinity (salinity ranged from 10 to 35 ).},

There is no unique solution to this problem. Thus, mammals and honeybees use their long-wavelength receptors for both achromatic (luminance) and colour vision, whereas flies and birds probably use separate sets of photoreceptors for the two purposes. In particular, we look at spectral tuning and diversification among `long-wavelength' receptors (sensitivity maxima at greater than 500{$\mkern1mu$}nm), which play a primary role in luminance vision. Data on spectral sensitivities and phylogeny of visual photopigments can be incorporated into theoretical models to suggest how eyes are adapted to coding natural stimuli. Models indicate, for example, that animal colour vision\textemdash involving five or fewer broadly tuned receptors\textemdash is well matched to most natural spectra. We can also predict that the particular objects of interest and signal-to-noise ratios will affect the optimal eye design. Nonetheless, it remains difficult to account for the adaptive significance of features such as co-expression of photopigments in single receptors, variation in spectral sensitivities of mammalian L-cone pigments and the diversification of long-wavelength receptors that has occurred in several terrestrial lineages.},

  abstract = {The results suggest that the overall structure of waving displays is evolutionarily labile, at the same time as being concentrated in a few particular axes of variation, possibly indicating evolution along lines of least resistance. Male fiddler crabs are commonly recognized by the presence of a single massive claw used in a variety of contexts, including territorial defence, agonistic interactions, and courtship behaviour. The most common behavioural context involving these enlarged chelipeds is their use in waving displays, which are remarkably diverse among species. Although the waving display is one of the most obvious behavioural features of male fiddler crabs, little is known about their main evolutionary trends during the diversification of the genus. The present study employed phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the evolution of waving behaviour in a sample of 19 species of Uca from Central and North America. Digital recordings were used to quantify the temporal dynamics of waving behaviour in each species. Multivariate ordination methods were used to assess whether different elements of the display showed distinct evolutionary dynamics, particularly with respect to body size and the environment where species are most commonly found. Most of the interspecific variation in displays involves differences in the overall waving velocity, with no correspondence to their local environments, nor their body size. Interestingly, despite the strong concentration of variance in the first two ordination axes, there was no statistically significant evidence for phylogenetic signals in their respective scores. These results suggest that the overall structure of waving displays is evolutionarily labile, at the same time as being concentrated in a few particular axes of variation, possibly indicating evolution along lines of least resistance. The approach employed in the present study highlights the utility of phylogenetic comparative methods for elucidating the evolution of complex behavioural characteristics, such as the waving display in male fiddler crabs.~\textcopyright{} 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 106, 307\textendash 315.},

We examined two types of fiddler crab females: wanderers moving through the population of courting males and residents that were occupying and defending their own territories. Sometimes residents leave territories to look for new burrows and we simulated this by displacing wanderers and residents and observing their behaviour while wandering. We predicted that the displaced wanderers would exhibit more mate-searching behaviours than resident females. However, wandering and resident females behaved nearly identically, displaying mate-searching behaviours and demonstrating matching mate preferences. Also, males behaved the same way towards both female types and similar proportions of wanderers and residents stayed in a male's burrow to mate. But more wanderers than residents produced egg clutches when choosing a burrow containing a male, suggesting females should be categorized as receptive and non-receptive. Visiting and rejecting several males is not the defining feature of female mate choice. Moving across the mudflat by approaching and leaving a succession of burrows (mostly occupied by males) is an adaptive anti-predator behaviour that is useful in the contexts of mate-searching and territory-searching.},

  abstract = {Fiddler crabs are intertidal brachyuran crabs that belong to the genus Uca. Approximately 97 different species have been identified, and several of these live sympatrically. Many have species-specific body color patterns that may act as signals for intra- and interspecific communication. To understand the behavioral and ecological role of this coloration we must know whether fiddler crabs have the physiological capacity to perceive color cues. Using a molecular approach, we identified the opsin-encoding genes and determined their expression patterns across the eye of the sand fiddler crab, Uca pugilator. We identified three different opsin-encoding genes (UpRh1, UpRh2 and UpRh3). UpRh1 and UpRh2 are highly related and have similarities in their amino acid sequences to other arthropod long- and medium-wavelength-sensitive opsins, whereas UpRh3 is similar to other arthropod UV-sensitive opsins. All three opsins are expressed in each ommatidium, in an opsin-specific pattern. UpRh3 is present only in the R8 photoreceptor cell, whereas UpRh1 and UpRh2 are present in the R1-7 cells, with UpRh1 expression restricted to five cells and UpRh2 expression present in three cells. Thus, one photoreceptor in every ommatidium expresses both UpRh1 and UpRh2, providing another example of sensory receptor coexpression. These results show that U. pugilator has the basic molecular machinery for color perception, perhaps even trichromatic vision.},

  abstract = {While mate choice is often assumed to be based on an absolute value that may reflect underlying male quality, many mating systems facilitate the comparative evaluation of males. Females can encounter a number of potential mates, either sequentially or simultaneously, before making a mate choice decision. Consequently, the attractiveness of one male may depend on the attractiveness of other males a female has previously encountered. To examine whether female choice in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi is based on the comparative evaluation of males, I altered the social context in which a set of males were encountered. Using a robotic crab system to manipulate claw size and wave rate directly, I determined female preference for two male options in the absence and presence of an asymmetrically dominating decoy option. The decoy male option was designed to change the relative attractiveness of the initial two male options. The presence of the decoy significantly altered the absolute preference, but not the relative preference, for the two male options. While this study clearly demonstrates that female U. mjoebergi are not using strict absolute preferences when ranking each male's attractiveness, it does not conclusively support comparative evaluation mechanisms. One possibility is that sexually selected traits in a complex signalling system often vary in how reliably they reflect male quality, and females may use a combination of absolute and comparative measures when assessing male quality.},

Once a female selects a mate, she copulates in his burrow and remains there until releasing her aquatic larvae. U. mjoebergi occurs in habitats that are inundated only by the highest amplitude spring tides. Females can only release their larvae during these tides, and release before or after will result in complete failure of reproductive effort. Matings occur over a 5-day period near the end of neap tides. Our results suggest that within the mating period, females adjust their larval developmental rates by selecting specific burrows in which to incubate their clutches. We found that at the start of the mating period, females chose larger males as mates. Since male size was positively correlated to burrow width, females were selecting wide burrows and effectively incubating at lower temperatures. This would slow down the developmental rates of larvae. In contrast, females that mated late in the mating period selectively chose small males. By incubating in narrower, warmer burrows, these females may increase the developmental rates of larvae. We propose that females are selecting burrows to influence incubation rate and ensure timely release of their larvae. Female U. mjoebergi appear to adjust their preference for the direct benefits of mate choice to increase their reproductive success.},

Allopatric conspecific crabs showed higher approaching and signalling than those in other conditions. The higher the crab density, the lower the interaction intensity between animals. Low-level agonistic signals were mainly displayed in high density (groups), while claw touch mainly occurred in pairs. Allopatric conspecifics showed the more intense agonistic interactions. Therefore, Uca seems to decrease energy investment in unnecessary fights against sympatric and conspecific crabs. Population density is a major factor driving agonistic behaviour mainly when conspecific animals are kept together. This may occur due to the increased competition for the same resources.},

It is known that females of D. pumiliopreferentially choose mates of their own color morph. Nevertheless, potential predators must clearly see and recognize all color morphs if the aposematic signaling system is to function effectively. We examined the ability of conspecifics and a model predator to discriminate a diverse selection of D. pumilio colors from each other and from background colors. Microspectrophotometry of isolated rod and cone photoreceptors of D. pumilio revealed the presence of a trichromatic photopic visual system. A typical tetrachromatic bird system was used for the model predator. Reflectance spectra of frog and background colors were obtained, and discrimination among spectra in natural illuminants was mathematically modeled. The results revealed that both D. pumilio and the model predator discriminate most colors quite well, both from each other and from typical backgrounds, with the predator generally performing somewhat better than the conspecifics. Each color morph displayed at least one color signal that is highly visible against backgrounds to both visual systems. Our results indicate that the colors displayed by the various color morphs of D. pumilio are effective signals both to conspecifics and to a model predator.},

In this regard, fiddler crabs draw attention by having flashy enlarged claws that could potentially attract the interest of many predators. Surprisingly, the adaptive function of claw coloration in fiddler crabs is not entirely understood and have barely been studied in American species. Here, we examine the spectral reflectance of thin-fingered (Leptuca leptodactyla) fiddler crabs' hypertrophied claws and evaluate whether female conspecifics prefer UV-light or other color cues. We test whether male claws reflect UV light and whether females use UV light and/or other color cues when making mating decisions. Our results reveal that only the most flamboyant enlarged claws should be detected by female conspecifics, which show a clear preference for male UV signals. Moreover, while the anterior portion of the enlarged claws (pointing towards conspecifics) reflect UV light, claws' dorsal portion and carapaces (which possibly point upwards and might attract airborne predators) do not show an UV peak. We also discuss the possibility of hypertrophied claws working as honest aposematic signals or playing an important role as decoys.},

Each one of these signals could possibly provide information to receivers about aspects of the sender's quality. Demonstrating condition-dependence of each of the multiple signals may shed light on which are related to the sender's quality. This is because condition-dependence can reliably convey the sender's quality due to the costs associated with signal production; only males in good condition are able to pay the costs of producing the signal. Male fiddler crabs use multimodal signals to attract females from a distance (they build semidomes and produce attraction waves) and for courting the females once they have approached (they produce courtship waves and substrate vibrations). Here, we investigate condition-dependence of the multimodal signals produced by the fiddler crab Austruca lactea. We manipulated the food levels of focal crabs (added food, control, removed food) for approximately 2~weeks in the field. We then compared the intensity of the male's signals and the male's blood lactate level. We found that the number of attraction waves significantly differed among treatments; the number of the waves increased with food availability. Blood lactate concentration also increased in the food-addition treatment. However, other signal traits were not significantly affected by the level of food available. These results suggest that adding food facilitated an increase in the male's ability to produce attraction waves, and this would impose higher energy costs. In this species, only attraction waving reflects male nutritional condition and so could potentially be used by females to distinguish between low- and high-quality males.},

  abstract = {Antipredator tactics that promote survival should be under strong selection. Therefore, apparently `risky' behaviours should only be stably maintained in a population if they confer a fitness advantage. Here, we experimentally examined the adaptive function of tail waving, an apparently risky antipredator behaviour in hatchling Australian three-lined skinks, Bassiana duperreyi, by determining the effects of running speed, incubation temperature, sex and parental environment on the frequency of tail waving in laboratory~trials. We found that hatchling running performance predicted tail-waving behaviour independent of the other factors, where slow individuals tail-waved more frequently than fast individuals. These data support the hypothesis that tail waving functions to deflect predatory attacks towards the tail, an expendable body part in this and other lizard species. Moreover, we suggest that tail waving in this species occurs as a `last resort' in response to fatigue. In addition, our results allow us to reject the hypothesis that tail waving primarily functions as a pursuit-deterrent signal in hatchling B.~duperreyi. Deflection is likely to have been the ancestral function of antipredator tail displays in lizards, with pursuit deterrence being a derived and less common function.},

Bees were trained to discriminate an achromatic stimulus from monochromatic lights of various wavelengths as a function of their intensity. Signal-to-noise ratios were measured by intracellular recordings in the three spectral types of photoreceptor cells. To model thresholds we assumed that discrimination was mediated by opponent mechanisms whose performance was limited by receptor noise. Most of the behavioural thresholds were close to those predicted from receptor signal-to-noise ratios, suggesting that colour discrimination in honeybees is affected by photoreceptor noise. Some of the thresholds were lower than this theoretical limit, which indicates summation of photoreceptor cell signals. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Spectral sensitivities, measured under bright conditions, for di\textendash, tri\textendash, and tetrachromatic eyes from a range of animals can be modelled by assuming that thresholds are set by colour opponency mechanisms whose performance is limited by photoreceptor noise, the achromatic signal being disregarded. Noise in the opponency channels themselves is therefore not statistically independent, and it is not possible to infer anything more about the channels from psychophysical thresholds. As well as giving insight into mechanisms of vision, the model predicts the performance of colour vision in animals where physiological and anatomical data on the eye are available, but there are no direct measurement of perceptual thresholds. The model, therefore, is widely applicable to comparative studies of eye design and visual ecology.},

These handicaps are of use to the selecting sex since they test the quality of the mate. The size of characters selected in this way serve as marks of quality. The understanding that a handicap, which tests for quality, can evolve as a consequence of its advantage to the individual, may provide an explanation for many puzzling evolutionary problems. Such an interpretation may provide an alternative to other hypotheses which assumed complicated selective mechanisms, such as group selection or kin selection, which do not act directly on the individual.},

  abstract = {With their eyes on long vertical stalks, their panoramic visual field and their pronounced equatorial acute zone for vertical resolving power, the visual system of fiddler crabs is exquisitely tuned to the geometry of vision in the flat world of inter-tidal mudflats. The crabs live as burrow-centred grazers in dense, mixed-sex, mixed-age and mixed-species colonies, with the active space of an individual rarely exceeding 1~m2. The full behavioural repertoire of fiddler crabs can thus be monitored over extended periods of time on a moment to moment basis together with the visual information they have available to guide their actions. These attributes make the crabs superb subjects for analysing visual tasks and the design of visual processing mechanisms under natural conditions, a prerequisite for understanding the evolution of visual systems. In this review we show, on the one hand, how deeply embedded fiddler crab vision is in the behavioural and the physical ecology of these animals and, on the other hand, how their behavioural options are constrained by their perceptual limitations. Studying vision in fiddler crabs reminds us that vision has a topography, that it is context-dependent and pragmatic and that there are perceptual limits to what animals can know and therefore care about.},
