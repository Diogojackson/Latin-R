  abstract = {Background Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. Although foraging behavior of male and female seabirds can vary markedly, differences in isotopic (carbon, {$\delta$}13C and nitrogen, {$\delta$}15N) foraging niche are generally more pronounced within sexually dimorphic species and during phases when competition for food is greater. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting Pygoscelis penguins asking whether environmental variability is associated with differences in male and female pre-breeding foraging niche. We predicted that all Pygoscelis species would forage sex-specifically, and that higher quality winter habitat, i.e., higher or lower sea ice coverage for a given species, would be associated with a more similar foraging niche among the sexes. Results P2/P8 primers reliably amplified DNA of all species. On average, male Pygoscelis penguins are structurally larger than female conspecifics. However, chinstrap penguins were more sexually dimorphic in culmen and flipper features than Ad\'elie and gentoo penguins. Ad\'elies and gentoos were more sexually dimorphic in body mass than chinstraps. Only male and female chinstraps and gentoos occupied separate {$\delta$}15N foraging niches. Strong year effects in {$\delta$}15N signatures were documented for all three species, however, only for Ad\'elies, did yearly variation in {$\delta$}15N signatures tightly correlate with winter sea ice conditions. There was no evidence that variation in sex-specific foraging niche interacted with yearly winter habitat quality. Conclusion Chinstraps were most sexually size dimorphic followed by gentoos and Ad\'elies. Pre-breeding sex-specific foraging niche was associated with overall SSD indices across species; male chinstrap and gentoo penguins were enriched in {$\delta$}15N relative to females. Our results highlight previously unknown trophic pathways that link Pygoscelis penguins with variation in Southern Ocean sea ice suggesting that each sex within a species should respond similarly in pre-breeding trophic foraging to changes in future winter habitat.},

  abstract = {Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting Pygoscelis penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica, asking whether environmental variability in the form of winter sea ice is associated with differences in male and female pre-breeding foraging niche. Each season, study nests, where pairs of adults were present, were individually marked and chosen before the onset of egg-laying, and consistently monitored. When study nests were found at the one-egg stage, both adults were captured to obtain blood samples used for molecular sexing and stable isotope analyses, and measurements of structural size and body mass. At the time of capture, each adult penguin was quickly blood sampled (\textasciitilde 1 ml) from the brachial vein. After handling, individuals at study nests were further monitored to ensure the pair reached clutch completion, i.e., two eggs. Molecular analyses were conducted at Simon Fraser University following standard PCR protocols, and stable isotope analyses were conducted at the Stable Isotope Facility at the University of California, Davis using an elemental analyzer interfaced with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer},
